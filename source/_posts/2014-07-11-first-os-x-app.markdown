One of my to-dos for today was to create a "Hello World" OS X app since I plan to learn Swift development through a tool I want to create to search for award seats using airline miles.  After watching a few youtube videos, particularly this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REjj1ruFQww I was able to create my own Hello World app fairly easily.  It didn't take nearly as long as I expected.  I also wanted to make sure I know how to build and distribute an app, so I tried that and got it uploaded at [https://s3.amazonaws.com/jbuploads/HelloWorld.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jbuploads/HelloWorld.zip).  Simple enough!

I was also able to get a basic design for http://www.bookitwithmiles.com up and running, though it still needs a lot of work.  This will be the site for my award ticket booking service.
