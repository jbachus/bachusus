Hi! I'm Justin Bachus, a creative technologist with over 15 years of experience in IT.  As a problem-solver with a passion for technology and automation, I'm skilled in seeing the big picture, designing, developing, and implementing solutions.  I've worked in software development, system and database administration, and systems implementation, making me uniquely qualified to bridge the gap between both business and technical teams.  I have an extensive track record developing and implementing solutions that meet and exceed expectations, are on budget, and on time.  I live in Salt Lake City, Utah and I'm a passionate tinkerer, skier, traveler, music lover, and outdoorsman in my free time.

If you're interested in working together, please check out my <!--[experience](/experience) and-->[résumé](/resume/), then [contact me](/contact/) to discuss how to get started.
